**The Site Does Not Provide Medical Advice**

LifePoints is a personal blog written by Nicole. My purpose is to share experiences and information as I seek to improve the health of my family through a real food lifestyle.

Information found on the LifePoints site is meant to motivate you to make healthy choices based on your own research in partnership with your health care provider. It should not be relied upon to determine dietary changes, a medical diagnosis or courses of treatment. The content is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read on this site! Reliance on any information provided by LifePoints, others appearing on the Site at the invitation of LifePoints, or other visitors to the Site is solely at your own risk.

Any statements or claims about the possible health benefits conferred by any foods or supplements have not been evaluated by the Food &amp; Drug Administration and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.

I do not promote anything that is inconsistent with my ideology. However, I do accept paid advertising, sponsorships, affiliate programs and other forms of compensation from companies I believe in.

For the purposes of complying with FTC rules, please assume that, for every recommendation, link, and product I use, the following all hold true:
