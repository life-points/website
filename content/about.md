I have always been fascinated with self-improvement. Since, I was young, you could find me reading books to inspire myself, sharing quotes, asking people random questions, and thinking up new ideas to try. Now I spend my time listening to podcasts, researching, reading, meeting new people, and continuing to pursue new goals. I am a new momma, entrepreneur, performer, educator, yogi, coffee lover, and most of all I love to share knowledge. This blog is my space to share all of it with you. It makes me happy to be able to have something I've learned impact someone else.  Here you will find pointers for your everyday life that I have learned along my life journey.
