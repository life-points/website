I am always trying to figure out the healthiest things to put on my body and in my body, so when it came to my baby, I was even more concerned! Here are my ten favorite natural products to use on my baby and a few products I feel are safe for baby to be on. Everything on my list is rated between a 1 and a 2 on the environmental working group website. I did a lot of research and my baby loves all of these products and I feel good about them too.

**Wipes:** [Water Wipes](https://amzn.to/2JloiDw)- These cleanup numero 2 very well and are made of just water and a little fruit extract. 

**
Lotion:** [Earth Mama Baby Angel Calming Lavender Lotion](https://amzn.to/2LeQc1a)- This has such a calming effect on the baby and is so smooth. I even use it for me, from time to time. I try to use it in all of his creases on his neck and have also used it for diaper rash. I also like using olive oil on his head for his cradle cap and on his body too.

**
Diaper Cream: **[Baby Mantra Natural Diaper Rash Ointment](https://amzn.to/2Jkh4PT)-This stuff is AMAZING! It clears up diaper rash super fast and is great for baby. It even helps him do numero 2. I also love that it is made with plant based ingredients. The only thing is that you only get 3.4 oz of it in a container, but a little bit goes a long way. 

**Diapers:** [Bambo Nature Diapers](https://amzn.to/2xG9fjc)-In the beginning, we were using pampers, huggies, and luvs, but I really wanted to find a natural brand. These actually hold up better for numero 2 and are really soft.. I also noticed that he doesn’t have diaper rash as much with these. 

**Vitamin D:** [Upspring Baby Vitamin D](https://amzn.to/2Lc3ADg)-The pediatrician recommended supplementing with this. They gave us a sample of this brand and we were hooked! It seems to be the most natural brand I have found and only made with coconut oil. He really likes the taste. 

**Sunscreen**-[Badger SPF 30 Baby Sunscreen](https://amzn.to/2szlBn5)-I don't like this brand for myself for sunscreen, but I love it for my baby. He hasn't been sunburn with it and it blends in smooth.

**Shampoo/Body Wash:** I try not to bathe him every day, so he has some natural oils on him. I bathe him with [Babo Botanicals Baby Shampoo and Wash](https://amzn.to/2JoKJro). A little drop goes a long way. I haven't had to purchase more than 1 since he was born. I also like[ Dr. Bronner’s Baby Unscented Pure Castile bar soap.](https://amzn.to/2svZspX)

**Nipple Cream**: [Mother Love Nipple Cream ](https://amzn.to/2xyUGxP)Even though this is technically for me, my baby is the one who is on my nipple the most. This heals my nipples anytime they are sore and I feel good about the ingredients, in case he tastes any of it.

**Laundry Detergent:** [Attitude Fragrance Free Little Ones Laundry Detergent](https://amzn.to/2J26yxj)-I love this detergent and it even is able to take off numero dos stains, if I let it sit on the spot for a bit before washing it. 

**Dishwashing liquid:** [Attitude Baby Bottle and Dishwashing Liquid](https://amzn.to/2JmgVvr)-For his pacifiers and bottles and teethers. 

**Baby Play Mats-**

**Travel Crib-**
