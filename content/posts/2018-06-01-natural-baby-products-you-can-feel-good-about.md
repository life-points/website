I am always trying to figure out the healthiest things to put on my body and in my body, so when it came to my baby, I was even more concerned! Here are my ten favorite natural products to use on my baby and a few products I feel are safe for baby to be on. Everything on my list is rated between a 1 and a 2 on the environmental working group website. I did a lot of research and my baby loves all of these products and I feel good about them too.

**Wipes:** [Water Wipes](https://amzn.to/2JloiDw)- These cleanup numero 2 very well and are made of just water and a little fruit extract. 

**
Lotion:** [Earth Mama Baby Angel Calming Lavender Lotion](https://amzn.to/2LeQc1a)- This has such a calming effect on the baby and is so smooth. I even use it for me, from time to time. I try to use it in all of his creases on his neck and have also used it for diaper rash. I also like using olive oil on his head for his cradle cap and on his body too.

**
Diaper Cream: **[Baby Mantra Natural Diaper Rash Ointment](https://amzn.to/2Jkh4PT)-This stuff is AMAZING! It clears up diaper rash super fast and is great for baby. It even helps him do numero 2. I also love that it is made with plant based ingredients. The only thing is that you only get 3.4 oz of it in a container, but a little bit goes a long way. 

**Diapers:** [Bambo Nature Diapers](https://amzn.to/2xG9fjc)-In the beginning, we were using pampers, huggies, and luvs, but I really wanted to find a natural brand. These actually hold up better for numero 2 and are really soft.. I also noticed that he doesn’t have diaper rash as much with these. 

**Vitamin D:** [Upspring Baby Vitamin D](https://amzn.to/2Lc3ADg)-The pediatrician recommended supplementing with this. They gave us a sample of this brand and we were hooked! It seems to be the most natural brand I have found and only made with coconut oil. He really likes the taste. 

**Sunscreen**-[Badger SPF 30 Baby Sunscreen](https://amzn.to/2szlBn5)-I don't like this brand for myself for sunscreen, but I love it for my baby. He hasn't been sunburn with it and it blends in smooth.

**Shampoo/Body Wash:** I try not to bathe him every day, so he has some natural oils on him. I bathe him with [Babo Botanicals Baby Shampoo and Wash](https://amzn.to/2JoKJro). A little drop goes a long way. I haven't had to purchase more than 1 since he was born. I also like[ Dr. Bronner’s Baby Unscented Pure Castile bar soap.](https://amzn.to/2svZspX)

**Nipple Cream**: [Mother Love Nipple Cream ](https://amzn.to/2xyUGxP)Even though this is technically for me, my baby is the one who is on my nipple the most. This heals my nipples anytime they are sore and I feel good about the ingredients, in case he tastes any of it.

**Laundry Detergent:** [Attitude Fragrance Free Little Ones Laundry Detergent](https://amzn.to/2J26yxj)-I love this detergent and it even is able to take off numero dos stains, if I let it sit on the spot for a bit before washing it. 

**Dishwashing liquid:** [Attitude Baby Bottle and Dishwashing Liquid](https://amzn.to/2JmgVvr)-For his pacifiers and bottles and teethers. 

**Baby Play Mats- **[Cream Haus Folding Play Mat](http://www.creamhaus.us/?aff=21)-It took me foreeeeever to find a mat for my baby that I felt good about. I researched the most nontoxic one, free from PVC, BPA, formamide, phthalates, fire retardants, and harmful VOCs and finally found this one!!! It is also certified by oeko-tex. ** **I wouldn’t have ever looked this much into a mat, but when we ordered other popular brands they had toxic smells that were giving me a headache-let alone my baby, so that’s when I investigated! This mat is more expensive than the others, but my baby is moving so much and it’s thick enough to cushion his falls!  Plus my husband already fell asleep on it and I’ve been doing some yoga on it!!

\    [The play gym by love every baby ](https://amzn.to/2LYLdmh)- This is a smaller mat, that you can put on top of the [cream haus](http://www.creamhaus.us/?aff=21). My baby learned so much from this. It has 100% baby-safe materials, FSC-certified wood and is made with organic cotton. I love that it helps your baby's physical, cognitive, visual, and  motor learning. It also gives you activity options, based on their development.        

**Travel Crib-**[Lotus Everywhere Travel Crib](http://guavafamily.refr.cc/nicoledonofrio)- This crib is amazing. It is easy to fold up to take whenever you travel anywhere. It's already been to Gramma's house and to NYC.  I love that it is non-toxic, [green guard certified](http://greenguard.org/en/index.aspx), has no flame retardants, has a clear, breathable mesh, and has a little opening so you can even lay with your baby. If you use my [discount code,](http://guavafamily.refr.cc/nicoledonofrio) you will receive a free cotton sheet when you purchase a travel crib.

I hope this list helps you find some great natural products for your baby.  I would love to hear about your favorite baby products in the comments below.
