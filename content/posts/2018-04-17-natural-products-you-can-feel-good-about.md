I love learning about health and wellness. As I started my journey learning about whole foods and listening to podcasts and reading blog posts about food, I also started thinking about not just what I put inside my body, but what goes on the outside of my body. Changing the food I eat, and what I put on my skin helped my skin clear up and my hair get fuller and helped me feel better overall.

The skin is the largest organ and absorbs everything you put on it. People use many products on their bodies everyday and many of these products are filled with harmful chemicals that are carcinogens, toxic to the reproductive system, and known to disrupt the endocrine system, according to the environmental working group. When looking for natural products, I go to http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ and I try to find the products with a low hazard score. I set out to find natural products and through trial and error, these are some of the natural products I use and love. Most of them are rated a 1.

**Toothpaste:** Dr. Bronner's Peppermint Toothpaste This toothpaste feels soft on my teeth. I never knew that was a thing, until I tried it. I love the minty flavor.

**Soap**: Dr. Bronners Organic Castile Soap I use the peppermint or hemp brand and it suds up still, which is important to me.

**Makeup**: Aunaturalecosmetics I don't wear too much makeup, but I use their lipstick, foundation, and eyeliner. I have the ruby lipstick, sand cream foundation, and eyeliner pencil in night. It is expensive, but lasts a surprisingly long time.

**Mascara:** I get my mascara from cvs and it is a really natural one. Physicians Formula Mascara This brand has many natural products.

**Facial cleanser:** I only use jojoba oil from trader joes to wash my face or if I don’t wear makeup, just water and if some pimples pop up, I dab a little Australian Tee Tree Oil on them and they go away fairly quickly.

**Lotion:** I have really dry hands, so sometimes I will put coconut oil  or olive oil on them or I use badger balm It works really well! 

**Stretch Marks:** I only used coconut oil this whole pregnancy. Unfortunately, I don’t think I used it enough so I do have some, but I have heard it works wonders for other people.

**Shampoo/Conditioner:** I really love this product. I mix and match with the shampoo and conditioner to experience two great scents. Acure Organics Moroccan Shampoo  and Acure Organics Pure Mint and Echinacea Conditioner

**Deodorant**: I used to use this which worked well Thai-Deodorant-Stone-Crystal-Deodorant Now I make my own. E-mail me at lifepoints.us@gmail.com for the recipe.

Bug Spray: For some reason, bugs are always attracted to me, so I needed to find a non toxic bug spray. I found this- Badger Anti-Bug Spray I honestly haven’t had a chance to use it yet, so I cannot say how well it works.

Perfume: I don’t wear it, but if I want a little scent, I just wear essential oils. What are your favorite essential oils to wear?

Tampons: This may be TMI, but I love this brand, Lola Tampons. It is a great company by women, for women transforming tampons. The Tampons are 100% cotton. If you sign up with my code you get $5 off. Did you know that the FDA doesn't require tampon brands to disclose a comprehensive list of ingredients, so most of them don't. I feel so much better, knowing what I am putting in my body.

Cleaners: I just started making my own with white vinegar, DR-BRONNERS-Pure-Castile-Soap, and essential oils and water and it smells so nice and works well. When I am too busy to make my own, I buy Attitude all purpose cleaner for around the house and Attitude Windows and Mirror Cleaner for our mirrors.

Sunscreen: I tried many and was determined to find one I liked, that actually worked and didn’t make me feel too sticky. Goddess Garden Organics Natural Suncreen does the trick.

Manuka Honey: It has lots of benefits. I use it when I am sick, for burns, for skin etc. I get mine from trader joes and use this brand, but there are so many out there. Here is a video with more about it and what number you need for what you are using it for.

Hair: I don’t use products on my hair, but if I feel it is a bit frizzy, I use Organic Argan Oil from Trader Joes.

Medicine: I really try to avoid medicine, if I can. When I start to feel a cold coming on I drink Ginger Tea with Apple Cider Vinegar, Oil of Oregano, Raw Honey and Cayenne Pepper and that normally does the trick. I make bone broth too and make sure to have lots of garlic, onion, and lemon.  I also make a Madjoon (See my blog post for that recipe).

Detergent: We recently started using this and I love it and a little bit goes a long way. Biokleen Laundry Detergent

Dish Detergent: Seventh Generation Dishwasher Detergent Packs  for our dishwasher or Attitude Baby Dishwashing Liquid for dishes, even though it is designed for baby safety, it works great to clean my stuff too.

Hand Soap: Dr. Bronner's Sugar Pump hand soap I couldn’t find this on ewg, so I am not sure the rating, but it feels so nice on your hands and you can even wash your face with it.

Toilet Bowl Cleaner: I just discovered this the other day and was totally amazed. I just sprinkle baking soda inside the toilet and leave it on for 5 minutes and then scrub it with a toilet bowl brush and it is sparkling clean.

There are still so many natural products I am still on a journey to discover, but I hope these helped!! Let me know if you discover any good natural products too!
