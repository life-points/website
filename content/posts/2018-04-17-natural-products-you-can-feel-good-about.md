I have a passion for learning about health and wellness. As I started discovering what foods felt best for my body through research and trial and error, I also started thinking about not just what I put inside my body, but what goes on the outside of my body. My skin was really breaking out and my hair was falling out and I needed some answers. As I started changing the food I eat, and what I put on my body, it helped my skin clear up, my hair to get fuller and helped me feel better overall.

The skin is the largest organ and absorbs everything you put on it. People use many products on their bodies everyday and many of these products are filled with harmful chemicals that are carcinogens, toxic to the reproductive system, and known to disrupt the endocrine system, according to the environmental working group. 

When looking for natural products, I go to [EWG ](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/)and I try to find the products with a low hazard score. I set out to find natural products and through trial and error, these are some of the natural products I use and love. Most of them are rated a 1. It has taken me a few years to come up with this list and I hope you find it informative.

**Toothpaste:** [Dr. Bronner's Peppermint Toothpaste](https://amzn.to/2ERsxjE) This toothpaste feels soft on my teeth. I never knew that was a thing, until I tried it. I love the minty flavor.

**Soap**: [Dr. Bronners Organic Castile Soap](https://amzn.to/2vk9XkP) I use the Peppermint and Hemp brand and it still suds up, which is important to me.

**Makeup**: [Aunaturalecosmetics ](https://www.aunaturalecosmetics.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwttbWBRDyARIsAN8zhbK0zTnI-9mPvxUy8kENL_4HKSlH-sC38zfHmwgzVTdlWj4VYDHgpj4aAkQpEALw_wcB)I don't wear too much makeup, but when I do, I go with their products. I use their lipstick, foundation, and eyeliner. I have the Ruby lipstick, Sand Cream foundation, and eyeliner pencil in Night. It is on the pricey side, but it lasts a surprisingly long time.

**Mascara:** I get my mascara from CVS and it is a  natural one. [Physicians Formula Mascara](https://amzn.to/2vsebad) is the one I use.  Somehow I always get coupons for a big discount on it. Subscribe to the CVS e-mails and you can save a lot.

**Facial cleanser:** I only use [Jojoba Oil](https://amzn.to/2qEQRAs) from Trader Joes to wash my face. When I don’t wear makeup, I only rinse it with water. If some pimples pop up, I dab a little [Australian Tee Tree Oil](https://amzn.to/2qFJzvZ) on them and they go away fairly quickly.

**Lotion:** I have really dry hands, so sometimes I will put coconut oil or olive oil on them. If they get really dry, I use [badger balm](https://amzn.to/2JQiu2h). It works really well! 

**Stretch Marks:** I only used coconut oil this whole pregnancy. Unfortunately, I don’t think I used it enough, so I do have some, but I have heard it works wonders for other people.

**Shampoo/Conditioner:** I really love this product. I mix and match with the shampoo and conditioner to experience two great scents. [Acure Organics Moroccan Shampoo](https://amzn.to/2H6z0gz)  and [Acure Organics Pure Mint and Echinacea Conditioner](https://amzn.to/2qFx1oC)

**Deodorant**: I used to use this which worked well- [Thai Deodorant Stone Crystal Deodorant](https://amzn.to/2qETzFS) Now I make my own. E-mail me at lifepoints.us@gmail.com for the recipe.

**Lip Balm:** I really like [Dr. Bronner's Lip Balm](https://amzn.to/2EUdoON)

**Bug Spray:** For some reason, bugs are always attracted to me, so I needed to find a non toxic bug spray. I found this- [Badger Anti-Bug Spray](https://amzn.to/2qETHVS) I honestly haven’t had a chance to use it yet, so I cannot say how well it works.

**Perfume:** I don’t wear it, but if I want a little scent, I just wear essential oils. What are your favorite essential oils to wear?

**Tampons:** This may be TMI, but I love this brand, Lola Tampons. It is a great company by women, for women, transforming tampons. The Tampons are 100% cotton. If you sign up with my [code](https://goo.gl/v3dBnm), you'll get $5 off. Did you know that the FDA doesn't require tampon brands to disclose a comprehensive list of ingredients, so most of them don't. I feel so much better, knowing what I am putting in my body.

**Cleaners:** I just started making my own with white vinegar, [Dr Bronner's Pure Castile Soap](https://amzn.to/2HG56wW), and essential oils (lemon) and water and it smells nice and works well. When I am too busy to make my own, I buy [Attitude all purpose cleaner ](https://amzn.to/2qD9AMs)for around the house and [Attitude Windows and Mirror Cleaner](https://amzn.to/2HGNRLV) for our mirrors.

**Sunscreen**: I tried so many and was determined to find one that actually worked and didn’t make me feel too sticky. [Goddess Garden Organics Natural Suncreen](https://amzn.to/2JSAxEJ) does the trick.

**Manuka Honey:** It has lots of benefits. I use it when I am sick, for burns, for skin etc. I get mine from trader joes and use this[ brand](https://amzn.to/2qFMe8X), but there are so many out there. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_MUon6mApU) is a video with more about it and what number you need for what you are using it for.

**Hair:** I don’t use products on my hair, but if I feel it is a bit frizzy, I use [Organic Argan Oil](https://amzn.to/2qFMF35) from Trader Joes.

**Medicine:** I really try to avoid medicine, if I can. When I start to feel a cold coming on I mix Ginger Tea with Apple Cider Vinegar, Oil of Oregano, Raw local Honey and Cayenne Pepper and that normally does the trick. I make bone broth too and make sure to have lots of garlic, onion, and lemon.  I also make a Madjoon (See my [blog ](https://www.lifepoints.net/posts/2018-01-16-things-i-ve-learned-from-my-persian-mother-in-law/)post for that recipe).

**Detergent:** We recently started using this and I love it and a little bit goes a long way-[Biokleen Laundry Detergent](https://amzn.to/2qGxnv0)

**Dish Detergent:** [Seventh Generation Dishwasher Detergent Packs ](https://amzn.to/2HG4rLZ) for our dishwasher or [Attitude Baby Dishwashing Liquid ](https://amzn.to/2qFhB3M)for dishes, even though it is designed for babies, it works great to clean my stuff too.

**Hand Soap:** [Dr. Bronner's Sugar Pump Hand Soap](https://amzn.to/2qIiSXT) I couldn’t find this on[ EWG](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/#.WtYeTS7wapo), so I am not sure the rating, but it feels so nice on your hands and you can even wash your face with it. A little bit goes a long way.

**Toilet Bowl Cleaner:** I just discovered this the other day and was totally amazed. I just sprinkle baking soda inside the toilet and leave it on for 5 minutes and then scrub it with a toilet bowl brush and it is sparkling clean.

There are still so many natural products I am still on a journey to discover, but I hope these helped!! Let me know if you discover any good natural products too!
