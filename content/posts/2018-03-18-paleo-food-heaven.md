I have been Paleo several times in my life, and it always makes me feel great, but having a baby, I felt I should include grains in my diet. Recently, I realized that Gluten, Soy, and Dairy bother my baby boy and corn bothers me. This makes options for eating out limited. I am so glad I stumbled upon this gem of a place. You will not find any gluten, soy, dairy, or corn here. and everything is organic. It is called, [NewBrook Kitchen & Artisan Market](https://www.newbrookkitchen.com/), and it is located in Westport, CT.

When you walk in you, the ownerâ€™s greet you right away and the ambiance is beautiful. It is so nice to see family all working together- Mother, Daughter, and Father. They sell all kinds of Paleo items from bagels to ice cream, to chocolate, to breads. They even sell locally made items and bracelets that say Paleo phrases.

I went with my baby and husband and we decided to try the Build your own Cauliflower Pizza. It starts at a base price of 15 dollars, or 10 dollars if you choose the vegan version (without eggs). It includes unlimited add-ons. We decided to do every add on (Spinach, Caramelized Onions, Roasted Zucchini, Roasted Butternut Squash, Shaved Brussel Sprouts, dried figs, and the Marinara Sauce). We also added the Burr-nada too it, which is vegan cheese made out of cashews, that seriously tastes like Burrata cheese.  It was big enough to split. This pizza tasted unbelievable, so healthy, and filled my pizza craving. We are serious pizza lovers and my husband makes an incredible pizza, so not being able to have gluten and dairy has been tough, but [NewBrook Kitchen](https://www.newbrookkitchen.com/) saved the day.

We also split the NB Veggie, which is a patty made with a beet, white sweet potato, plantain and eggplant. It is served over asian slaw and topped with curry cream. It was also really delicious and had a saltier taste for salt lovers.

They have so many menu choices from salads to sandwiches, bites for your kiddos, sides, and desserts

Both of these meals were very filling and they even poured us filtered water. 

A mother and daughter run the restaurant and are both chefs. They both were diagnosed with an autoimmune disease at the same time and a paleo diet helped control their symptoms.  This is the inspiration behind this healthy spot. 

They are open from Tuesday through Friday from 10am to 5pm and Saturdays from 10am to 2pm. We will definitely come back.
