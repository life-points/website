At the start of this pandemic, baking cookies, bread, and muffins were my top priority, but as time went on, I went back to focusing on eating healthy and working out. What I realized after trial and error is how you can get fit without spending anything. 

First, you need a reason why you want to get fit. For me, I was noticing groceries were getting harder to lift, shoveling was exhausting, and my energy as a mama was running low. What is your why behind working out?

I was feeling all of this, but it wasn't until I noticed a good friend of mine posting about how she was working out that really made me get on the fitness bandwagon. I asked her what she was doing and she recommended, [Fit.like.krys](https://www.fitlikekrys.com/). I now follow her on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fit.like.krys/) and have done her free challenges two times. I am in the process of repeating her challenge again because it is that good. I honestly only work out 10 minutes each morning and follow her checklists. By following her workouts, I have become so much stronger and am now able to shovel our whole driveway, play tag with my son all day, and lift heavy things. I also lost weight, fit into my clothes better and just feel healthier overall. 

Another free workout is [Yoga with Adriene](https://yogawithadriene.com/). You can do her monthly workouts or find any video on her youtube page for a variety of topics. Her workouts help you to really focus on your mind, body, and spirit and finding what feels good for you. 

[FitnessBlender](https://www.fitnessblender.com/) is another site with totally free workouts. I've done a few of these and they are great.

Daily walks are another thing I love. It is amazing to walk and notice what is around you in nature and meditate or pray.

Some other ways to fit working out in are running, walking, biking, doing jumping jacks, jumping rope, etc. I have also tried belly dancing, barre classes, zumba and more all for free online. It is really all about finding out what makes you move and why.

Working out clears your mind to focus on even more goals. It shifts you into a positive mindset and gets your energy up. 

Most importantly is fueling your body with healthy foods. You can eat food at home more, have more fruits and veggies, stay away from processed foods, and check the ingredients on labels. 

You can get fit. All it takes is a shift in your mindset. I'd love to hear how you have been staying in shape and and if you need some encouragement, feel free to email lifepoints.us@gmail.com
