I have always loved reading since I was a little girl. I remember my mom driving me to lessons, and my head was always stuck in a book. Reading on the beach is my favorite thing to do. When I became a mom, I really started analyzing the books I was reading to my son and found myself changing the word's quickly or switching the book I was reading. It has become really important to me to read positive books to my son. Here is a list I have compiled of books I feel comfortable having on our bookshelf.

1. [Dear Boy](https://amzn.to/3ei6CEp) and [Dear Girl](https://amzn.to/3gnu9Ws) 

Whether you have a boy or a girl, each one of these books is super uplifting. My son now repeats some of the positive affirmations and they are easy to use throughout the day. I highly recommend these books! The author's story is very interesting too.

This book covers the same bucket filling concept, but is great for older kids, ages 4 to 9. It is a great way to show kids the impact they have in this world and about the power of positivity. I have read this in the classroom and children love it and we always have great discussions after we read it.
