I have always loved creativity. Since I was a little girl, creating with my imagination was my favorite thing. It still is, as I have created a whole business just around that idea. Sometimes it can be hard to get in a creative zone, when you are juggling work, parenting, and everday life. I'd like to share what has changed my creative process.

There is a beautiful book called, [The Artist's Way](https://amzn.to/3ukjRgU), that has highly influenced my life. I was told to read it by many people. I started the book many times and somehow couldn't get through it. This past March, I finally decided that I was going to read this book and finish it and I did it! From this book, I now do morning pages every morning, as soon as I wake up. It is just a stream of conciousness and I write whatever I am thinking. I realized that I was repeating some of the same thoughts everyday and that realization helped me change those thoughts.

I also started figuring out what exactly brought me joy in my life through taking myself on an artist date. For me, coloring to folk music, trying out new workouts, watching short films, going out for coffee, are just a few of the things that really inspire and bring me joy. By taking the time to do these things, it gets my creative juices flowing.

I also started getting out in nature more and really being present with everything around me. Water is the biggest thing that inspires me in nature. For you it may be something else. Go out there and find out.

This book brought me back to loving piano and songwriting. It brought me back to getting into a routine for myself. I have now created a schedule where I have a day I chat with friends, a day to spend time with my husband, a day to focus on learning something new , a day to practice music and a day to do something I love. I spend a few hours on those days focusing on those things.

Reading positive books with a focus on a growth mindset has also helped me get creative and playing with my son and letting my imagination be free has been a big part of it too. 

[Affirmation cards](https://amzn.to/3dvTgaA) are also a helpful way to change your thinking and focus on the positive.

Letting go of the need to show people your work and do something for you can also be very freeing. It allows you to create without an expectation and to be silly and free with your work.

In my business, I teach adults and children ways to tap into their inner child and through improv we get creative. Teaching taps into creativity for me and it creates an ability to connect with someone else's creativity too. There is an amazing exchange in improv that needs creativity to happen.

Creativity looks different for everyone. You may find your creativity through cooking, baking, sewing, painting, singing, gardening, building, writing, etc. It is a beautiful gift when you tap into it.

I'd love to hear what gets your creative juices flowing and would feel so honored if you shared anything you have created with me. Happy Creating!
