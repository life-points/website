Coffee and I have had a long road together. I have been drinking it for a while and it has been the topic of many conversations with my friends. It has really brought me joy. The feeling of walking into a new coffee shop has always been exciting and fun, especially when we travel to a new city. I have gone from drinking Dunkin Donuts, to Starbucks, to strictly local coffee shoppes, to getting beans the day after they were roasted. 

As I started working out, I began to feel this natural energy before I even drank my first cup of coffee. Some mornings I would delay drinking it for a while and when I finally drank my first cup of coffee, I realized I had a lot more energy before I drank it. I decided to experiment and cut coffee. I cut it cold turkey! I do not recommend doing this, if you drink a lot of coffee. I was only drinking 1 cup a day, so it worked out for me. Dr. Axe has a 5 day weaning off plan that you can check out [here](https://draxe.com/health/coffee-detox/). I did have headaches for a couple days and fell asleep so fast at night, but as the days followed, I realized I had more energy than before. 

I went about 50 days without a cup of coffee and now drink it occasionally on a weekend or if I really miss the taste of it but have mostly eliminated it from my life.

My relationship with coffee changed and I am thankful that I see it in a new light. I encourage you to look at relationships in your life, whether that be with a friend, a family member, a food, a beverage, a device, or something else. How can those relationships change for the better?
