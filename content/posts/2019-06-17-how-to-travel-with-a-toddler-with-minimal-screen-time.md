I was always scared to travel on a plane with my son when he was younger. Then when he turned 1, I felt more comfortable and decided to give it a try. We have now gone on two trips. We first went to Florida and then to San Francisco. I really prepared for each trip by asking more experienced mothers for their advice and researching as much as I could. I didn't expect to be stuck in an airport and airplane for 16 hours, when our airline experienced bad weather, circled in the air for hours, took us on and off the plane, and finally at 11pm at night canceled our connecting flight and landed us in a different state without a place to stay. (Thanks American Airlines).

I always try to find the positive in these experiences and what I am thankful for is how well my son did through all of this, with only 1 episode of Daniel Tiger. These are the things that saved the day and I hope they help you too.

1. [The Buckle Toy](https://amzn.to/2KXA1by) This toy consumed a good chunk of time on the plane. He loved working on the buckles. At first I helped him, but now he can do it on his own and it helped him identify colors too. We still use this every car ride and at restaurants too.
