I love reading inspirational books. I guess once I read Chicken Soup for the Soul as a youngster, I was hooked. Self-help books always seem to get me thinking and some are so powerful that they are able to change you. Below are the top books that have impacted my life and my favorite quotes from them.

1. The Celestine Prophecy- My dad gave this book to me and although it is fiction, I think about it often. There are 9 insights in the book and the messages really spoke to me. My favorite quote from it is this... “It says that whenever people cross our paths, there is always a message for us. Chance encounters do not exist. But how we respond to these encounters determines whether we’re able to receive the message. If we have a conversation with someone who crosses our path and we do not see a message pertaining to our current questions, it does not mean there was no message. It only means we missed it for some reason.” Because of this, whenever I bump into someone I know, I always try to make a point to talk to them.
