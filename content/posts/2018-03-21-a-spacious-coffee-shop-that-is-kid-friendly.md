The other day, a mom friend and I decided to venture out to a coffee shop with our babies. As a first time mom, I am still getting used to taking my baby out, so I needed to find a coffee shop that understands kids, is spacious, and where you don't feel like everyone is staring at you, if your baby starts crying or babbling. [Candlewood Market Coffee and Tea Emporium ](https://www.candlewoodmarket.com/)was the perfect spot!

The doors seemed as though they were made for a stroller to fit through them. I had my baby in his [LILLEBABY carrier](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KC4VPNU/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=lifepoints02-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00KC4VPNU&linkId=7d1967a10172dfc09ff479d6c003f91d) that day, and as soon as I walked in, the barista chatted with me and my baby. She was very friendly and didn't rush my order.  They had so many different types of coffee and also sold breakfast (sandwiches, croissants, muffins, oatmeal), lunch (sandwiches, soups, salads), teas, chai, frozen drinks and smoothies. They sell nitro cold brew coffee and tea, and kombucha on tap.  My friend ordered the milky way latte and I ordered a cappuccino with almond milk. Both tasted great.  They have plenty of seats and beautiful wooden tables. There is also a fun kid's area in the back.

In the shop, there were people working on computers, people casually reading, people who had just left the gym and moms with their toddlers,. I love to people watch and it was nice to see all different people there.

It is a family owned and operated business and they have been roasting coffee for 12 years. They are located at the sportsplex in Fairfield and there is ample parking. I am excited to venture there again with the whole family.
