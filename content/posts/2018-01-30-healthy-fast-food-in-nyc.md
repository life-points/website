I eat about 90% organic, and try to limit grains. I used to be strictly paleo and I also have followed whole 30. The tricky part about dietary restrictions is going out to eat. Where can you go and still stick to your diet or shall I say lifestyle? HU Kitchen is your place!

Their slogan is "Get back to Human." When you enter, you will not find any conventional sweeteners, gluten, soy, GMO corn, commercial lecithins, no carrageenan, no preservatives, no chemically decaffinated coffee, no conventional chocolate, no canola/vegetable oils, no unverified natural flavors, no industrially-produced ascorbic or citric acids, no dextrin/maltodextrin, no refined sugar, no msg, and no gums. Are you hungry yet?

It is pretty incredible, because with all of this stuff missing, you can get some delicious real food. I love to get their bowls. I normally get the root vegetable mash with grass fed beef on top. I also love their organic coffee, chocolate, homemade almond milk and juices. Sometimes I will treat myself to one of their grain free muffins. 

They sell breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks there and are a market as well. It is a great place to meet with friends, do work, or just people watch. It feels nice to know that you are sitting with a community of health conscious people.
