This year has been a year of finding my daily rhythm. I was really inspired after watching this [video](https://www.ted.com/talks/manoush_zomorodi_how_boredom_can_lead_to_your_most_brilliant_ideas), How Boredom Can Lead to your Most Creative Ideas. Growing up as a kid, I had lots of time to be "bored" and I am very thankful for the things I discovered in that time of boredom. It helped my life in many ways. 

As I have grown older, it has been easy to gravitate toward my phone, social media, tv, etc. in those times of boredom. As I have realized this, I started to make a habit of changing my daily rhythm.

Here are my steps to establishing your daily rhythm

**\#1**: Decide what you want your morning to look like. Before you get out of bed or look at your phone, how do you want to start your day?

For me, this looks like journaling, writing affirmations, reading an inspiring or educational book and the bible. I have all of those right by my bed, so I can flood my mind with them right away. 

**\#2**: Decide what will nourish your soul and keep you feeling your best and do that first thing. Is it wearing an outfit you feel good in? Is it working out? Is it meditating or eating a healthy breakfast?

For me, this looks like working out, doing a meditation, and eating a healthy filling breakfast.

**\#3**: Decide how you will fill your mind with positivity throughout the day. Let go of what isn't serving your mind and is adding stress or negativity to your life.

This takes time because it is very individualized for each person. It could be when you go on social media, it brings you down or watching the news. If so, eliminate those. Think about the things that bring you joy and fill your day with that in your free moments.

For me this looks like listening to positive music, taking walks, getting outside, being mindful of time on social media, and watching something funny/inspiring.

**\#4**: Decide how to make the things you don't enjoy more joyful. Sometimes it could be your job, or chores around the house. How can you make those things a little bit brighter?

For me, listening to a podcast while I wash the dishes gets me washing dishes much faster. 

**\#5**: Decide how you want to end your night. What do you want to be in your subconscious mind? If you watch the news, that will be in your head. If you watch a scary movie, that will be in your mind. What can you fill into your mind to add peace to your life?

For me, I like to journal what I am grateful for, chat with a positive friend on the phone,  spend time with family, read a book or learn something new.

We have 365 days a year to design our days. I'd love to hear your daily routine and what brings you joy.
